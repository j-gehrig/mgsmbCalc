# mgsmbCalc

This W.I.P. C++ repository contains an [eval library](./mgsmbEval), [math library](./mgsmbMath) and [Console Calculator](./mgsmbCalc-Console).<br>
For the eval library I chose to use my own math library, meaning the algorithms might not be very good until I improve them.<br>
##### Currently, functions are broken. I'm working on fixing that.<br>
<br>
<br>

## To do list:
1. Fix the eval library
2. Improve my math library
3. Improve the console application
4. Learn QT and make a GUI calculator app
6. Improve code (Adding comments, making code more readable)
8. Make the libraries and calculators faster
